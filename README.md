## Installation
See [Releases](https://github.com/JanluOfficial/Feedstream/releases/tag/release). Download the latest version for your platform. (Windows currently available)

To compile from source, make sure you have Python 3.12.4 or later, and Nuitka. Then, you can run either `build.bat`. If you're not on Windows, you can also try to run `build-macos.sh` on MacOS or `build-linux.sh` on Linux, depending on your platform. Keep in mind that Feedstream has been tested on Windows so far, so it may not work on other platforms.
